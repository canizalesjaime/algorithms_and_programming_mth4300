## Arrays Continued
In C++, an array is a data structure that can hold a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type. Arrays are useful for storing multiple values in a single variable and can be accessed using an index.


#### Array Size
The size of an array is fixed when it is declared. However, you can use the sizeof operator to determine the number of elements in an array:

#### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int size = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);
    cout << "Array size: " << size; // Outputs 5
    return 0;
}
```

### Multidimensional Arrays
C++ also supports multidimensional arrays, such as 2D arrays, which can be visualized as tables.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
type arrayName[rows][columns];
```

#### Example:

```cpp
int matrix[3][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```
You can access elements in a 2D array using two indices:

#### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int matrix[3][3] = {
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9}
    };
    cout << matrix[0][0]; // Outputs 1
    cout << matrix[1][2]; // Outputs 6
    return 0;
}
```
### Key Points
* Arrays have a fixed size, which must be known at compile time.
* The size of the array can be determined using sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]).
* Elements are accessed using zero-based indexing.


## Recursion
In C++, recursion is a process in which a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem. This approach divides a larger problem into smaller sub-problems, solving each one by breaking it down until reaching a base case, which is the simplest form of the problem that can be solved directly.

### Key components of recursion:
* Base Case: The condition that stops the recursive calls to prevent infinite recursion. It directly returns a result without making further recursive calls.
* Recursive Case: The part of the function where the problem is broken down into smaller sub-problems, and the function calls itself with a modified argument.
 

### Example of Recursion in C++
Let's consider a simple example where we calculate the factorial of a number using recursion:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Recursive function to calculate factorial
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        // Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1;
    } else {
        // Recursive case: n * factorial of (n-1)
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    int number = 5;
    cout << "Factorial of " << number << " is " << factorial(number) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### How it works:
* Base Case: if (n == 0) stops the recursion and returns 1.
* Recursive Case: For values greater than 0, the function calls itself with n-1.
In this example:

* factorial(5) calls factorial(4), which calls factorial(3), and so on until factorial(0), which returns 1.
* Then, the calls unwind and the results are multiplied to give the final result.

### Advantages of Recursion:
* Simpler and more intuitive code for problems that can naturally be broken into sub-problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, tree traversal).

### Disadvantages of Recursion:
* Can be inefficient in terms of both time and space due to repeated function calls and stack memory usage.
* Risk of stack overflow if recursion depth becomes too large.
Recursion is a powerful tool but should be used with care, especially for problems that can have a large depth of recursive calls.


## Function Call Stack
In C++, when a function is called recursively, the compiler uses a **call stack** to manage function calls and local variables. This is a crucial part of how recursion works.

---

### **1. What is the Function Call Stack?**
The **function call stack** is a **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** data structure used by the compiler to store:
1. **Function return addresses**
2. **Local variables**
3. **Parameters passed to functions**
4. **Saved registers (context switching between functions)**

Each function call creates a **stack frame** that holds the above information. When a function returns, its frame is popped from the stack.

---

### **2. How the Call Stack Works in Recursion**
Let's consider a recursive function to compute factorial:

### **Example: Factorial Function**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;  // Base case
    return n * factorial(n - 1);  // Recursive call
}

int main() {
    cout << "Factorial of 5: " << factorial(5) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### Execution Steps (Stack Frames)
| Call          | Function         | Return Address            | Local Variables |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| `main()`      | Calls `factorial(5)` | --                       | `n = 5`        |
| `factorial(5)` | Calls `factorial(4)` | `return 5 * factorial(4)` | `n = 5`        |
| `factorial(4)` | Calls `factorial(3)` | `return 4 * factorial(3)` | `n = 4`        |
| `factorial(3)` | Calls `factorial(2)` | `return 3 * factorial(2)` | `n = 3`        |
| `factorial(2)` | Calls `factorial(1)` | `return 2 * factorial(1)` | `n = 2`        |
| `factorial(1)` | Calls `factorial(0)` | `return 1 * factorial(0)` | `n = 1`        |
| `factorial(0)` | Returns `1` (Base Case) | --                     | `n = 0`        |


Once `factorial(0)` returns `1`, the stack starts popping:

- `factorial(1) â†’ return 1 * 1 = 1`
- `factorial(2) â†’ return 2 * 1 = 2`
- `factorial(3) â†’ return 3 * 2 = 6`
- `factorial(4) â†’ return 4 * 6 = 24`
- `factorial(5) â†’ return 5 * 24 = 120`

Finally, `main()` receives the result `120` and the program ends.

### 3. Stack Overflow in Recursion
If recursion depth is too large, the stack runs out of space, causing a stack overflow error.

#### Example of Infinite Recursion (Stack Overflow)
```cpp
void infiniteRecursion() {
    infiniteRecursion();  // No base case
}

int main() {
    infiniteRecursion();  // Stack overflow!
    return 0;
}
```
Since there's no base case, the function never terminates, and the call stack fills up until the program crashes.

### 4. Tail Recursion Optimization
#### Problem with Regular Recursion
Each recursive call creates a new stack frame, increasing memory usage. Tail recursion is a technique where the recursive call is the last operation in the function, allowing the compiler to optimize memory usage.

#### Example of Tail Recursion (Optimized)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int tailFactorial(int n, int result = 1) {
    if (n == 0) return result;  // Base case
    return tailFactorial(n - 1, n * result);  // Tail recursive call
}

int main() {
    cout << "Factorial of 5: " << tailFactorial(5) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
ðŸ’¡ In tail recursion, the compiler can replace recursive calls with a loop internally (tail call optimization). However, C++ does not guarantee tail call optimization.

### 5. Function Call Stack vs. Explicit Stack
Instead of recursion, we can use an explicit stack (like ```std::stack```) to manage function calls manually.

#### Example: Iterative Factorial Using a Stack
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

int factorial(int n) {
    std::stack<int> s;
    int result = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        s.push(i);

    while (!s.empty()) {
        result *= s.top();
        s.pop();
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Factorial of 5: " << factorial(5) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Advantages of an explicit stack: âœ” Avoids recursion overhead.
âœ” Prevents stack overflow for deep recursion cases.

### Conclusion
* The function call stack is used to manage recursion.
* Each recursive function call creates a stack frame that stores local variables and return addresses.
* Stack overflow occurs when too many recursive calls fill up the memory.
* Tail recursion can optimize memory usage in some compilers.
* Explicit stacks (```std::stack```) can be used instead of recursion for better control.

## Practice Examples
1. Write a C++ program, that prompts the user for the number of rows and 
columns in a 2-dimensional array. For each cell in the 2d array, if the column
is even compute row raised to column(r^c) and store in that cell, otherwise 
store 0. For row 0 and col 0(arr[0][0]), you can just store 0(since indeterminate).
Print the computed 2d array. 

**Example:** let the input be 4 for row and 5 for column, then the output will be:<br>
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
 1 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 4 \\
 1 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 9 
\end{bmatrix}
```

2. In C++, write a function that computes the nth fibonacci number from the 
fibonacci sequence. Make sure to use recursion in your function.
